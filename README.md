# New-Life-Laptop-Refurbish
I had an issue with a slow loading 10-year old HP Pavilion x360 and decided to give it an extended life!

#*Issues*

Failing Hard Drive

No Operating System

Limited Storage

Slow Operation Speeds

#*Tasks/Solution*

1.Replace HHD with SSD hardrive (more function, boosts processing speeds)

2.Upgrade RAM from 4GB to 8GB (increase short-term memory space)

3.Install windows 10 with Bootable USB

#*Materials Used*

SSD - Kingston 240GB A400 SATA 3 2.5

RAM - 8GB 2Rx8 PC3L 12800S DDR3L

Wesdut Screw driver set

#*What did I learn*

I became more familiar with the components of a computer and how they work

I now know how to download a windows 10 onto a bootable USB and have this for future use!

#*Results*

Loading times and boot up speeds under 30secs!

Windows operating system installed with linux up next!
